      "        2. Regular consumption of tomatoes or tomato products has been shown to improve cardiovascular health by reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels (Benefit).\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being (Benefit).\n",
      "        4. Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to tomatoes, leading to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing (Health Concern).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Tomatoes contain histamine, a compound that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with mast cell activation disorder or histamine intolerance.\n",
      "        2. Tomatoes belong to the nightshade family, which includes potatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers. Some people with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, follow a nightshade-free diet due to the belief that these foods exacerbate their symptoms. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim.\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes contain salicylates, a type of natural chemical found in many plants. Some people with food intolerances or sensitivities may experience symptoms such as headaches, rashes, or gastrointestinal distress after consuming tomatoes or tomato products.\n",

      "        1. Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid, which have been shown to have potent antioxidant effects. These antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (1, 2).\n",
      "        2. Blueberries have anti-inflammatory properties due to their anthocyanins and other polyphenolic compounds. Chronic inflammation is linked to various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even certain types of cancer. Regular consumption of blueberries may help reduce inflammation in the body (3, 4).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Blueberries are generally considered safe for individuals with common food allergies, such as gluten, lactose, and peanut allergies, as they do not contain significant amounts of these allergens.\n",
      "        2. Blueberries are naturally free from the top eight allergens identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which include milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.\n",
      "        3. Blueberries are suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets, as they are plant-based and do not contain animal products.\n",

      "        1. Chicken is a rich source of high-quality protein, which is essential for building and repairing body tissues. It also contains all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own.\n",
      "        2. Chicken is low in saturated fat and trans fat, making it a good choice for people looking to maintain a healthy weight or reduce their risk of heart disease. It is also a good source of selenium, vitamin B6, and niacin, all of which contribute to heart health.\n",
      "        3. Health concerns: Chicken, especially the skin and dark meat, can be high in cholesterol. Consuming large amounts of chicken regularly may increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer due to the presence of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) formed during cooking at high temperatures.\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Chicken is a common allergen: Chicken is one of the most common sources of food allergies. People with chicken allergies may experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, itching, and difficulty breathing after consuming chicken or its products.\n",
      "        2. Chicken is not suitable for lactose intolerant individuals: Chicken itself does not contain lactose. However, dairy products such as milk, cheese, and butter are often used in the preparation of chicken dishes, making them unsuitable for individuals with lactose intolerance.\n",
      "        3. Halal and Kosher dietary restrictions: Chicken is a staple food in both Halal and Kosher diets. Halal dietary restrictions require that the chicken be slaughtered in a specific way, while Kosher dietary restrictions require that the chicken be prepared in accordance with specific religious laws.\n",

      "\n",
      "                                            1. Sugar provides quick energy by supplying the body with simple carbohydrates, which are easily converted into glucose in the bloodstream. This can be beneficial for athletes or individuals who need an immediate energy boost. (Health Benefit)\n",

      "                                            3. Regular consumption of sugary foods and drinks can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body becomes less sensitive to insulin and has difficulty regulating blood sugar levels. (Health Concern)\n",

      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Sugar is a common ingredient in many processed foods, making it difficult for individuals with food allergies or intolerances to avoid it entirely. For example, milk sugar (lactose) is a common allergen, and individuals with lactose intolerance may need to avoid sugars derived from milk.\n",
      "        2. Some religious dietary restrictions, such as those observed in Islam (Halal) and Judaism (Kosher), prohibit the consumption of certain types of sugar, such as pork-derived gelatin or non-kosher certified refined sugars.\n",
      "        3. Individuals with fructose intolerance or diabetes may need to limit their sugar intake due to the potential negative effects on their health. Fructose intolerance can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, while excessive sugar intake can lead to weight gain, insulin resistance, and other health issues.\n",
