      "        1. Improved Muscle Protein Synthesis: Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis more effectively than whole whey protein or other protein sources due to its rapid absorption rate and high bioavailability of essential amino acids, particularly leucine, which plays a crucial role in initiating muscle protein synthesis (1, 2).\n",
      "        2. Supports Immune Function: WPI contains immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and cysteine, which contribute to its immunomodulatory effects. Several studies have demonstrated that hydrolyzed WPI supplementation can improve immune function, reduce inflammation, and enhance the body's ability to fight infections (3, 4).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) is a milk-derived protein that undergoes hydrolysis, a process that breaks down larger protein molecules into smaller peptides and amino acids. This makes it easier for individuals with lactose intolerance to digest, as the lactose content is significantly reduced.\n",
      "        2. For individuals with allergies to milk proteins, hydrolyzed WPI may be a viable alternative, as the allergenic epitopes, which trigger an allergic response, are typically removed during the hydrolysis process. However, it is essential to note that some individuals with severe milk allergies may still react to hydrolyzed WPI.\n",

      "        1. Tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that has been linked to a reduced risk of various types of cancer, including prostate, breast, lung, and stomach cancer (Benefit).\n",
      "        2. Regular consumption of tomatoes or tomato products has been shown to improve cardiovascular health by reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol levels, as well as lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke (Benefit).\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes contain vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being (Benefit).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Tomatoes contain histamine, a compound that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with mast cell activation disorder or histamine intolerance.\n",
      "        2. Tomatoes belong to the nightshade family, which includes potatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers. Some people with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, follow a nightshade-free diet due to the belief that these foods exacerbate their symptoms. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim.\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes are rich in salicylates, a type of natural chemical found in many fruits, vegetables, and spices. People with food intolerance to salicylates may experience symptoms such as headaches, rashes, and gastrointestinal distress after consuming tomatoes.\n",

      "  [HEALTH EFFECTS]: \n",
      "        1. Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid, which have been shown to have potent antioxidant effects. These antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (1, 2).\n",
      "        2. Blueberries have anti-inflammatory properties due to their anthocyanins and other polyphenolic compounds. Chronic inflammation is linked to various health issues including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Regular consumption of blueberries may help alleviate inflammation and improve overall health (3, 4).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Blueberries are generally considered safe for individuals with common food allergies, such as gluten, lactose, and peanut allergies, as they do not contain significant amounts of these allergens.\n",
      "        2. Blueberries are naturally free from the top eight allergens identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which include milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.\n",
      "        3. Blueberries are suitable for vegetarian and vegan diets, as they are plant-based and do not contain animal products.\n",
      "        4. Blueberries are halal and kosher certified, making them suitable for individuals following these religious dietary restrictions.\n",

      "💬 LLM-Generated Health Summaries:\n",
      "  [HEALTH EFFECTS]: \n",
      "        1. Chicken is a rich source of high-quality protein, which is essential for building and repairing body tissues. It also contains all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own.\n",
      "        2. Chicken is low in saturated fat and cholesterol, making it a good choice for people looking to maintain a healthy weight or reduce their risk of heart disease. However, it's important to note that the skin and dark meat contain more fat than the white meat.\n",
      "        3. Chicken is a good source of various vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins, selenium, and zinc. These nutrients are important for maintaining a healthy immune system, energy levels, and overall health.\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Chicken is one of the most common causes of food allergies, particularly in relation to egg and feather proteins. People with chicken allergies may experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing after consuming chicken or chicken products.\n",
      "        2. Some individuals have intolerances to certain components of chicken, such as histamine or sulfites, which can cause digestive issues, headaches, and other symptoms. These individuals may need to avoid chicken or limit their consumption to manage their symptoms.\n",
      "        3. Certain religious and cultural dietary restrictions prohibit the consumption of chicken or poultry. For example, Hindus, Jains, and some Muslims do not eat chicken or other birds due to ethical or religious beliefs.\n",

Sugar provides quick energy by supplying the body with simple carbohydrates, which are easily converted into glucose in the bloodstream. This can be beneficial for athletes or individuals who need an immediate energy boost. (Health Benefit)\n",

      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Sugar is a common ingredient in many processed foods, making it difficult for individuals with food allergies or intolerances to avoid it entirely. For example, milk sugar (lactose) can pose a problem for lactose intolerant individuals, while corn syrup can be problematic for those with corn allergies.\n",
      "        2. Some religious dietary restrictions, such as those observed in Islam (Halal) and Judaism (Kosher), prohibit the consumption of certain types of sugar, such as pork-derived gelatin or non-kosher certified refined sugars.\n",
      "        3. For individuals with diabetes or other metabolic disorders, sugar intake must be carefully monitored due to its high glycemic index, which can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels.\n",
