      "        1. Improved Muscle Protein Synthesis: Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis more effectively than whole whey protein or other protein sources due to its rapid absorption rate and high bioavailability of essential amino acids, particularly leucine, which plays a crucial role in initiating muscle protein synthesis (1, 2).\n",
      "        2. Supports Immune Function: WPI contains immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and cysteine, which contribute to its immunomodulatory effects. Several studies have demonstrated that hydrolyzed WPI supplementation can improve immune function, reduce inflammation, and enhance the body's ability to fight infections (3, 4).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) is a milk-derived protein that undergoes hydrolysis, a process that breaks down larger protein molecules into smaller peptides and amino acids. This makes it easier for individuals with lactose intolerance to digest, as the lactose content is significantly reduced.\n",
      "        2. For individuals with allergies to milk proteins, hydrolyzed WPI may be a viable alternative, as the allergenic epitopes (antigenic sites) of the milk protein are broken down during hydrolysis, reducing the likelihood of an allergic reaction. However, it is essential to note that some individuals with severe milk allergies may still react to hydrolyzed WPI.\n",

      "        2. Consuming tomatoes regularly may help improve cardiovascular health by reducing the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol and increasing HDL (good) cholesterol, as well as lowering blood pressure (Benefit).\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes contain significant amounts of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being (Benefit).\n",
      "        4. Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to tomatoes, leading to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing (Health Concern).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Tomatoes contain histamine, a compound that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with mast cell activation disorder or histamine intolerance.\n",
      "        2. Tomatoes belong to the nightshade family, which includes potatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers. Some people with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, follow a nightshade-free diet due to the belief that these foods exacerbate their symptoms. However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim.\n",

      "        1. Blueberries are rich in anthocyanins, a type of flavonoid, which have been shown to have potent antioxidant properties. These antioxidants help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (1, 2).\n",
      "        2. Blueberries have anti-inflammatory effects due to their anthocyanins and other polyphenolic compounds. Chronic inflammation is linked to various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Regular consumption of blueberries may help alleviate inflammation and improve overall health (3, 4).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Blueberries are generally considered safe for individuals with common food allergies, such as gluten, lactose, and peanut allergies, as they do not contain significant amounts of these allergens.\n",
      "        2. Blueberries are naturally free from the top eight allergens identified by the Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) organization, which include milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.\n",
      "        3. For individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, blueberries are a safe fruit option as they do not contain gluten. However, cross-contamination with gluten-containing foods may occur during processing or preparation.\n",
      "        4. Blueberries are considered halal and kosher, making them suitable for individuals following these dietary restrictions based on religious beliefs.\n",

      "        1. Chicken is a rich source of high-quality protein, which is essential for building and repairing tissues in the body. It also provides all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own.\n",
      "        2. Chicken is low in saturated fat and trans fat, making it a good choice for people looking to maintain a healthy weight or reduce their risk of heart disease. It is also a good source of selenium, vitamin B6, and niacin, all of which contribute to heart health.\n",
      "        3. Chicken contains choline, a nutrient that is important for brain development and function. It also contains tryptophan, an amino acid that helps the body produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates mood and sleep.\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Chicken is one of the most common sources of food allergies, particularly in relation to eggs and feathers. People with chicken allergies may experience symptoms such as hives, swelling, and difficulty breathing upon consumption.\n",
      "        2. Chicken is also a common cause of intolerances, particularly lactose intolerance. While chicken itself does not contain lactose, it is often prepared with dairy products, such as butter or cheese, which can cause issues for those with lactose intolerance.\n",
      "        3. For religious dietary restrictions, such as those observed in Islam (Halal) and Judaism (Kosher), specific guidelines must be followed in the preparation and handling of chicken. Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in the meat being considered unacceptable for consumption.\n",

      "        4. Consumption of added sugars, particularly sugary beverages, has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (2).\n",
      "        6. Fructose, a simple sugar found in fruits and added sugars, is metabolized differently than glucose and can contribute to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease when consumed in excess (3).\n",
      "        8. On the other hand, natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables provide essential nutrients and fiber, contributing to overall health and well-being (4).\n",
      "        10. Regular consumption of sugary foods and beverages can lead to tooth decay due to the production of acid by bacteria in the mouth (5).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Sugar is a common ingredient in many processed foods, making it difficult for individuals with food allergies or intolerances to avoid it entirely. For example, milk sugar (lactose) can pose a problem for lactose intolerant individuals, while corn syrup can be problematic for those with corn allergies.\n",
      "        2. Some religious dietary restrictions, such as those observed in Islam (Halal) and Judaism (Kosher), prohibit the consumption of certain types of sugar, such as pork-derived gelatin or non-kosher certified refined sugars.\n",
