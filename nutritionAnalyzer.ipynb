      "        1. Improved Muscle Protein Synthesis: Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) has been shown to enhance muscle protein synthesis more effectively than whole whey protein or other protein sources due to its rapid absorption rate and high bioavailability of essential amino acids, particularly leucine (1). This makes it an ideal supplement for athletes and older adults aiming to build or maintain muscle mass.\n",
      "        2. Enhanced Immune Function: WPI contains immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and cysteine, which have been linked to improved immune function (2). Specifically, immunoglobulins help neutralize pathogens, while lactoferrin plays a role in iron metabolism and antimicrobial activity. Cysteine is a precursor to glutathione, an important antioxidant.\n",
      "  [RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) is a milk-derived protein that undergoes hydrolysis, a process that breaks down larger protein molecules into smaller peptides and amino acids. This makes it easier for individuals with lactose intolerance or milk allergies to digest and consume.\n",
      "        2. For individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance, hydrolyzed WPI is generally considered safe as it is derived from milk, not wheat or other gluten-containing sources. However, it is essential to check the label for potential cross-contamination during manufacturing processes.\n",
      "        3. Vegetarians and vegans cannot consume hydrolyzed WPI as it is derived from milk, making it an unsuitable protein source for those adhering to these dietary restrictions.\n",

Enhances Muscle Protein Synthesis: Whey protein isolate (WPI) is a high-quality protein source, rich in essential amino acids, particularly leucine, which plays a crucial role in initiating muscle protein synthesis (MPS) (1). Regular consumption of WPI, especially post-workout, has been shown to increase MPS, leading to muscle growth and repair (2).\n",
      "        2. Supports Weight Management: WPI can aid in weight management by promoting satiety and reducing hunger. A study showed that consuming a whey protein shake before a meal led to a significant reduction in caloric intake at the next meal (3). Additionally, another study found that those who consumed a whey protein supplement lost more weight and body fat compared to those who did not (4).\n",

However, some whey protein isolates are produced using advanced filtration techniques that remove lactose and allergens, making them suitable for people with these restrictions.\n",
      "        2. For individuals following religious dietary restrictions, such as veganism or halal/kosher diets, whey protein isolate is not an option due to its animal origin. Plant-based protein sources, such as soy, pea, or rice protein, are more suitable for these dietary restrictions.\n",
      "        3. Whey protein isolate may not be suitable for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as kidney disease or phenylketonuria (PKU), due to its high content of essential amino acids, particularly leucine and phenylalanine\n",
