      "        1. Hydrolyzed whey protein isolate (WPI) is derived from cow's milk, making it unsuitable for individuals with lactose intolerance or milk allergies. However, some hydrolyzed WPI products may be lactose-free due to the enzymatic hydrolysis process that breaks down lactose into galactose and glucose.\n",
      "        2. Hydrolyzed WPI is a complete protein source, containing all essential amino acids. It is often used as a protein supplement for individuals with dietary restrictions, such as vegetarians or vegans, who may have difficulty obtaining adequate protein from plant-based sources alone.\n",

      "        2. Consuming tomatoes regularly may help improve cardiovascular health by reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke due to their high levels of potassium, vitamin C, and beta-carotene (Benefit).\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes contain solanine, a glycoalkaloid that can be toxic in large quantities, causing symptoms such as headache, nausea, and paralysis (Concern). However, the amount of solanine in tomatoes is usually low and not a cause for concern when consumed in normal amounts.\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",
      "        1. Tomatoes contain histamine, a compound that can trigger allergic reactions in some individuals, particularly those with mast cell activation disorder or histamine intolerance.\n",
      "        2. Tomatoes belong to the nightshade family, which includes potatoes, eggplants, and bell peppers. Some people with certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis, follow a nightshade-free diet due to perceived inflammatory effects.\n",
      "        3. Tomatoes are rich in salicylates, a type of naturally occurring phenolic compound. Individuals with salicylate sensitivity or intolerance may experience symptoms such as headaches, rashes, or gastrointestinal distress upon consuming tomatoes.\n",

These antioxidants can help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's (Bennett et al., 2009).\n",
      "        2. Blueberries have anti-inflammatory effects, which can help reduce inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation has been linked to various health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Kalt et al., 1999).\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",

Blueberries are naturally free from the top eight allergens identified by the Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) organization: milk, eggs, fish (e.g., bass, flounder), crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, shrimp), tree nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, pistachios, walnuts), peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.\n",

      "        2. Chicken contains selenium, zinc, and vitamin B6, which are important for immune function, thyroid health, and the production of red blood cells. Regular consumption of chicken can help boost the immune system and improve overall health.\n",
      "        3. Chicken is low in saturated fat and trans fats, making it a good choice for people looking to maintain a healthy weight or reduce their risk of heart disease. However, it is important to avoid adding excessive amounts of salt, sugar, or unhealthy fats when cooking or preparing chicken dishes.\n",
      "  [DIETARY RESTRICTIONS]: \n",

For example, milk sugar (lactose) is a common allergen, and individuals with lactose intolerance may need to avoid sugars derived from milk.\n",
      "        2. Some religious dietary restrictions, such as those observed in Islam (Halal) and Judaism (Kosher), prohibit the consumption of certain types of sugar, such as pork-derived gelatin or non-kosher certified refined sugars.\n",
