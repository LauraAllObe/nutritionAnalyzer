Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and one-sample <i>t</i>-test. A comprehensive literature review on salt reduction strategies was also performed proposing a model for an optimized low-salt fermented dairy product. This study found high salt content in many fermented dairy products. Brined cheese had the highest salt level (7.57\\u2009g/100\\u2009g), while pizza processed cheese had the lowest (1.03\\u2009g/100\\u2009g). Probiotic yogurts contained less salt (0.29\\u2009g/100\\u2009g) than regular ones. Other products like doogh (1.04\\u2009g/100\\u2009g), kefir (0.63\\u2009g/100\\u2009g), and kashk (2.78\\u2009g/100\\u2009g) also contributed significantly to salt intake. Most products exceeded recommended salt limits. Consuming just one serving of these products often accounted for a substantial portion of the daily recommended salt intake (WHO: 5\\u2009g/day). This research emphasizes the need for reducing salt in fermented dairy products to improve public health. This study highlights the excessive salt content in many fermented dairy products, surpassing recommended daily intake levels. Therefore, to address this public health concern, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. For this purpose, Policymakers should implement stringent monitoring, enforce food labeling, and develop legislation to reduce salt content. Furthermore, the food industry must innovate to reduce salt while maintaining product quality and taste. On the other hand, consumer education and awareness campaigns are crucial for informed choices. Additionally, further research is needed to understand consumer perceptions and the long-term impact of salt-sustainable reduction strategies on dietary habits and public health.'}\n",

The reduction of dietary salt consumption is a modifiable risk factor. The WHO recommends a daily sodium intake of <2000 mg but average consumption exceeds this in many countries globally. Strategies proposed to aid effective salt reduction policy include product reformulation, front of pack labelling, behavioural change campaigns and establishing a low-sodium-supportive environment. Yet, salt for household and processed food use is, in countries wholly or partially adopting a universal salt iodisation policy, the principal vehicle for population-wide iodine fortification. With salt reduction policies in place, there is concern that iodine deficiency disorders may re-emerge. Recognising the urgency to tackle the rising prevalence of NCDs yet not risk the re-emergence and detrimental effect of inadequate iodine intakes, this review lays out the feasibility of integrating both salt reduction and salt iodine fortification strategies. Reducing the burden of health risks associated with an excessive sodium intake or inadequate iodine through population-tailored, cost-effective strategies involving salt is both feasible and achievable, and represents an opportunity to improve outcomes in public health.'}\n",

Repeated injections of vaccine resulted in suppression of antibody titers. Both gammaG and gammaM antibodies were rapidly increased by booster injections after rest periods during which titers had decreased to low levels. The O agglutinin titers and the amount of antibody protein, as determined by precipitation with endotoxin, generally were parallel, except in serum specimens in which unusually large proportions of the agglutinating activity were found in the gammaG fraction. These exceptions were explained by the greater agglutinating capacity of the gammaM. Endotoxin precipitated about 10 times as much antibody from gammaG preparations as it did from gammaM fractions of equivalent agglutinating strength. A much higher proportion of the serological activity, therefore, was found in the gammaG fractions when antibody was measured by precipitation than when agglutination was used as the measure of activity.'}\n",

The diet of Lithuanian adults was found insufficient as the energy intake from fats exceeded the recommended norms, while the energy intake from carbohydrates was below the lower range. The intakes of dietary fibre and most vitamins and minerals were insufficient. Men, compared to women, had a statistically higher total energy intake and energy intake from fats, and a higher intake of dietary fibre. Younger adults, compared to older ones, had statistically lower intakes of energy from fats, including saturated fats, and lower intakes of sodium chloride. Respondents with primary education, compared to those who had attained a higher degree of education, had a statistically lower intake of total energy and dietary fibre. Study showed that intakes of majority of nutrients in the diet of the adult Lithuanian population are not in compliance with the recommended daily intakes. Continuous nationally representative studies into food consumption and nutrient intake of the adult Lithuanian population must be carried out to assess the changes in the population's diet and the effectiveness of policies aimed at promoting healthy diets.\"}\n",

Supplementation is necessary when a sufficient amount of vitamin C is not obtained through the diet. Alternative formulations of vitamin C may enhance its bioavailability and retention over traditional ascorbic acid. This systematic review consolidates the evidence on this and the effects on immunity and infection. A systematic literature search was conducted in October 2024 in Embase and Medline, focused on healthy adults (Population); oral forms of liposomal-encapsulated ascorbic acid, liposomal-encapsulated lipid metabolite ascorbic acid, calcium ascorbate, slow-release ascorbic acid, or lipid metabolite ascorbic acid (Intervention); compared to placebo/others (Comparison); in terms of bioavailability, absorption, vitamin C concentration in plasma, serum, and leukocytes, and impacts on tolerability, immunity, and infection (Outcome); and included randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, single-arm trials, and observational studies (Study design). Thirteen studies were included, several evaluating calcium ascorbate in combination with vitamin C metabolites, including L-threonate, referred to here as Calcium ascorbate EC (Ester C<sup>®</sup>; n = 7). No safety or tolerability concerns were noted with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. placebo or ascorbic acid. Calcium ascorbate EC showed better tolerability and fewer epigastric adverse events, improved quality of life, and induced favorable oxalate changes vs. ascorbic acid. Four studies reported leukocyte vitamin C concentration, some showing higher concentrations with Calcium ascorbate EC vs. ascorbic acid; seven reported more favorable plasma concentrations with the alternative forms over ascorbic acid or placebo; one reported higher serum vitamin C levels with vitamin C lipid metabolites than with Calcium ascorbate EC, calcium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid. No study reported retention in tissues. One study reported a favorable impact of Calcium ascorbate EC on immune parameters, and one found an association of Calcium ascorbate EC with fewer colds and a shorter duration of severe symptoms vs. placebo. Findings suggest that alternative vitamin C forms can improve leukocyte vitamin C, sometimes without affecting plasma levels. Most studies (77%) had a low risk of bias. In conclusion, the type and delivery modality of vitamin C can impact its bioavailability and functionality. Studies highlight the advantages of Calcium ascorbate EC over traditional ascorbic acid in terms of its tolerability and its potential to increase leukocyte vitamin C concentrations, crucial for immune function and protection against infection. However, further research is required to conclusively establish its effects on immune health.'}\n",

The sunflower lecithin (phytosome) formulation of <i>Curcuma longa</i> and <i>Boswellia serrata</i> demonstrated beneficial effects on intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a lecithin-based delivery formulation of <i>Curcuma longa</i> and <i>Boswellia serrata</i> extracts (CUBO) on SBD in IBS subjects.<h4>Subjects</h4>Forty-nine adult subjects with IBS and SBD were randomly supplemented for 30 days with CUBO and a low-FODMAP diet (LFD) (intervention) or with LFD and placebo (control group).<h4>Results</h4>The intervention group showed a significant reduction in urinary indican (<i>p</i> < 0.001), which was the marker of SBD, and of abdominal bloating (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and abdominal pain (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The pre-post control group analysis did not evidence significant differences. The comparison between the two groups (net effect in intervention minus control subjects) showed that the changes differ significantly for urinary indican <i>p</i> < 0.001 (-42.88; 95% CI: -62.04 to -23.72), abdominal bloating <i>p</i> < 0.001 (-1.50; 95% CI: -1.93 to -1.07), and abdominal pain <i>p</i> < 0.001 (-2.37; 95% CI: -3.61 to -1.13) and for the global assessment of efficacy (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

The dissemination of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms occurs via a multitude of pathways, including the food supply. The failure to comply with the regulatory withdrawal period associated with the treatment of domestic animals or the illicit use of antibiotics as growth promoters has contributed to the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in meat and dairy products. It was demonstrated that not only do animal and human pathogens act as donors of antibiotic resistance genes, but also that lactic acid bacteria can serve as reservoirs of genes encoding for antibiotic resistance. Consequently, the consumption of fermented foods also presents a potential conduit for the dissemination of AR. This review provides an overview of the potential for the transmission of antibiotic resistance in a range of traditional and novel foods. The literature data reveal that foodborne microbes can be a significant factor in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.'}\n",

However, there is no well-studied research evaluating the effects of combined interventions on the fitness and immune systems of PLWHA. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effects of exercise and dietary intervention on physical fitness, quality of life and immune response in PLWHA.<h4>Methods</h4>This was an experimental study, with a sample of 25 male PLWHA divided into two groups: the intervention group (IG: 12 participants) and the control group (CG: 13 participants). All participants have not had any exercise habits and nutritional supplements in the past six months. The participants in the IG completed 45\\xa0min of exercise (60-80% HRmax) 4 times per week for 4 weeks. The exercise was in the form of brisk walking or running. They were also given a nutritional dietary supplement 3 times a day for 4 weeks. The 13 individuals in the CG continued their normal daily life (physical activity and diet). The following parameters were evaluated before and after the intervention: body composition, physical fitness, immune response, quality of life (QoL), stress, dietary behavior, dietary habits, exercise motivation, and physical self-efficacy.<h4>Results</h4>The significant changes were observed in burnout of stress variables and physical efficiency index (PEI) of physical fitness in the IG (p\\u2009=.023). Moreover, in the saliva samples, sal-T levels significantly increased only after the intervention in the IG (p\\u2009=.012). Additionally, regarding the analysis of the interaction (group × time), there was a significant improvement in the reaction speed (p\\u2009=.001) and grip strength (left: p\\u2009=.002, right: p\\u2009=.030) and a significant difference in physical satisfaction in QoL (p\\u2009=.001), stress burnout (p\\u2009=.043), self-confidence in physical efficacy (p\\u2009=.045), external display (p\\u2009=.008), and fulfillment (p\\u2009=.047) in exercise motivation. Moreover, the significant effect of the intervention on emotional eating in dietary behavior was shown in the comparison of the IG before and after intervention (p\\u2009=.001) and in the comparison of the IG group with the CG after the experiment (p\\u2009=.013). However, there was no significant effect of time or interaction between the condition and time on body composition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In conclusion, exercise training and diet therapy caused changes in physical fitness and Sal-T levels, which had positive effects on the health promotion of PLWHA.'}\n",

Exploring the plethora of conventional wisdom regarding therapeutic flora for sustainable use and drug development is a timely endeavor. Thus, the present study was aimed at investigating therapeutic plant uses and conservation practices by the local communities dwelling in the vicinity of the Park.<h4>Methods</h4>Eighty randomly selected general informants and 20 purposefully selected key informants were used to collect the traditional lore from 10 purposefully selected kebeles that border the Park. Data were collected using face-to-face interviews, guided field walks, group discussions and market surveys. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the basic information collected from the informants. An independent sample t test was computed to compare the knowledge variations among different informant groups. Clustering and ranking techniques were employed to validate traditional wisdom of informants.<h4>Results</h4>Significant differences in traditional wisdom (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) were observed only between general and key informants. Hundred thirteen therapeutic plant species belonging to 56 families were recorded. Asteraceae was the most species-rich family (10%). The majority of therapeutic species were collected from the wild (77%). Herbs and roots were the most preferred habit (47%) and plant parts (37%) for remedy preparation, respectively. Pounding was the most common preparation method (50.1%). The most frequently practiced route of administration was the oral route (48.1%). The highest Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) value (84%) was recorded for respiratory and febrile illnesses. Rumex nepalensis was the most preferred for the treatment of wounds, and Olea europaea subsp cuspidata was\\xa0the first-ranked multipurpose plant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The Park is rich in therapeutic species serving as a refuge for many endemic and endangered species associated with the local community rich medicinal traditional lore. Erosion of therapeutic plants, verbal transfer of the traditional wisdom and young generation negligence in acquiring traditional lore led to the deterioration of the long tradition of using therapeutic plants for health care. Endangered multipurpose therapeutic plants like Echinops kebericho should get conservation priority. Therapeutic plants with the highest ICF and fidelity level could be candidates for drug development.'}\n",
